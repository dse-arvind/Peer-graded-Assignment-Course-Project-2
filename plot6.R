##Subset the VehiclesSSC based on fips and add a column for the city name, then combine the two data frame to generate data for both cities

NEIvehicleBalti<-subset(NEIvehicleSSC, fips == "24510")
NEIvehicleBalti$city <- "Baltimore City"
NEIvehiclela<-subset(NEIvehicleSSC, fips == "06037")
NEIvehiclela$city <- "Los Angeles County"
NEIBothCity <- rbind(NEIvehicleBalti, NEIvehiclela)

##Plot the result by facets for each city

 ggplot(NEIBothCity, aes(x=year, y=Emissions, fill=city)) +
  geom_bar(aes(fill=year),stat="identity") +
 facet_grid(.~city) +
 guides(fill=FALSE) + theme_bw() +
 labs(x="year", y=expression("Total PM"[2.5]*" Emission (Kilo-Tons)")) + 
 labs(title=expression("PM"[2.5]*" Motor Vehicle Source Emissions in Baltimore & LA, 1999-2008"))
 
 
##To View the maximum change in the emission levels

aggregateEmissions <- aggregate(Emissions~city+year, data=NEIBothCity, sum)
aggregate(Emissions~city, data=aggregateEmissions, range)
